This repository contains code for "Capstone Project - Case Study 1" done as part of Coursera Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.
The purpose of this script is to consolidate downloaded Divvy data into a single dataframe and then conduct simple analysis to help answer the key question: “In what ways do members and casual riders use Divvy bikes differently?”
